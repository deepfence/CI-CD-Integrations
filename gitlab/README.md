# Gitlab CI/CD Demo: Simple Go Server Application.

[This](https://gitlab.com/deepfence-gitlab/simple_go_server) project builds and deploys a "Hello World" Go webapp. It provides an example of how to build and test a Dockerized 
web application on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com). The image can later be pushed to any remote registry of choice.

### Configure environment variables on Gitlab
The following [environment variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/) must be set for the project on Gitlab 
via the project settings (i.e `Project > Settings > CI/CD > Variables`) page, before the project can be built successfully.


| Variable                       | Description                                               |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DEEPFENCE_CONSOLE_IP`         | Deepfence management console ip address                   |
| `DEEPFENCE_DOCKER_PASSWORD`    | Deepfence docker hub username                             |
| `DEEPFENCE_DOCKER_USERNAME`    | Deepfence docker hub password                             |
| `FAIL_CVE_COUNT`               | Fail the build if number of vulnerabilities found >= this value. Set -1 to pass regardless of vulnerabilities.  |
| `FAIL_CVE_SCORE`               | Fail the build if cumulative CVE score is >= this value. Set -1 to pass regardless of cve score.  |
